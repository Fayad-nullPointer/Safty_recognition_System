# Safty_recognition_System
The goal of my project was to develop an image recognition system that can detect whether individuals in a work environment are wearing the necessary safety clothes, such as helmets and vests. This technology could be a game-changer in enhancing workplace safety, ensuring compliance with safety regulations, and ultimately protecting lives.
